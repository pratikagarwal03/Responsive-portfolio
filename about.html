          <p>
            I have over 3 years of exerience as a software engineer, and have
            worked at both small startups and large organizations. While I'm a
            proficient full-stack developer, my expertise is in building
            scalable backend services using Laravel. I love building things.
            While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to
            tackle. I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a
            business justification.
